# Project Name: PromptIT

Summary:
PromptIT is a web game that combines the power of AI-generated images with human creativity and ingenuity. The game revolves around players taking turns describing images generated by Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion Model. These descriptions are then used to generate new images, which are passed onto the next player for further description. Each round, the descriptions are evaluated by a Perplexity AI, considering factors like accuracy , creativity and detail. Additionally, PromptIT offers intriguing side challenges to keep gameplay engaging and diverse, such as restricting the use of certain words or mirroring image descriptions.

The platform is also designed from the ground up with Figma.

# Technologies Used:
 * Nuxt 3
 * Vue 3
 * Tailwind CSS
 * Firebase: Firestore, Realtime database and Firebase storage.
 * Google Auth
 * Stability.AI and Perplexity.AI

# Features:
* Utilises Stability.AI for generating images with its stable-diffusion-v1-6 model.
* Employs Perplexity AI’s mistral-7b-instruct model to evaluate player descriptions based on accuracy and creativity. Utilising prompt engineering to ensure a consistent, confident judging system to fairly award points.
* Offers various side challenges to add depth and excitement to the gameplay. Each of which are powered by fine-tuned prompts to get desired information.
* Automated game logic powered by Perplexity AI, including win condition calculation.
* Realtime live chat for communication between friends and keeping the gameplay interactive. Writing descriptions for the images is also real-time and adds a layer of suspense and keeps every player up to date on their friends’ statuses.
* Built with Nuxt 3, Vue 3, and Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive player interface.
* Integrated with Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage) for seamless data management and real-time updates.
* Google auth for easy sign up and login management.

# Setting up the server locally
We have an instance of the app set-up on Netlify at https://main--promptit.netlify.app/ (note that while the main functionalities of the app works, it could be buggy at times). The app should also be accessed through a computer instead of a mobile device. <br /> It is also quite simple to run this game locally. 
Node and npm are required to run the project. <br /> Each player would need to clone the repository and run the following command:
```
npm i
```
from within the root of the project to install the necessary packages before
running:
```
npm run dev
```
to initiate the server. 
Although each instance would run locally, they all connect to the same database and therefore could participate in multiplier games.

* Upon submitting their description, players are given unrestricted view to the generated images and other player prompts.
* Players can engage in side challenges to spice up the gameplay.
* At the end of each round, Perplexity AI evaluates descriptions based on accuracy and creativity at the end of each round while also checking against a list of dynamically generated side challenges to determine the number of points players get.

* The game continues until every player has gone first in a round (so for n players there would be n rounds).
* The player with the highest combined points at the end of the game wins.
